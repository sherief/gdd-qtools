Hall of Mirrors bug fix

Included in this archive is a file hom_fix.txt describing the fix I

gddqvis3 is based off of code that id Software has released to the
public, but NOT into public domain.  Thus, don't try selling this
for money on any CD collection or anything or I may not be the only
one who gets annoyed.

QVIS3 Revision 1.03
===================

Command Line parameters added to GDDQVIS3:

  -cullerror

  Prevents the Leaf portals saw into leaf error.  May run slightly faster during the
  initial steps of qvis3.

  ***********  This does not correct errors that may have occured during the qbsp3
  * WARNING *  process that result in the bsp taking long to process and having
  ***********  more visible polygons.  Do not use this if you are not using fixed
               version of qbsp3 that currects the face merge bug, or possibly serious
  slowdowns with map may be hidden.  Version 1.051 of gddqbsp3 fixes this along with
  versions of qbsp3 by Alexander Malmberg and David Hyde.

  -maxdist <distance>
  -maxfovdist <fov> <distance>

  This option keeps nodes that are more than <distance> units apart from being able
  to see each other.  This happens during the fastvis stage, so you do not need to
  full vis to see the effect.  However, use of this feature must be used with care,
  as due to its very nature, cause hall of mirror effects unless you geometry is
  set up right to hide this.  There are several uses for this.

  One is if you have built your map such that it is not possible to see very far,
  you can use this to prevent vis from even considering nodes that should not be
  able to see each other anyway.  As the vis process is just an approximation,
  you still have to be careful, and placement of hint brushes may be neccessary
  to effectively use this feature for this.

  THe other main use is with Quake 2 mods that feature fog.  If it is known that a
  map will be used with fog that will not allow the user to see farther than a
  certain distance away, then there is no need to draw geometry past this point.
  Some care has to be taken with this as most hardware only checks against z
  value instead of true distance to the eye.  Objects on the edge of the screen
  will fog out at farther distances from the eye than objects directly in front
  of the eye.  The <fov> parameter on the second version will make the adjustments
  neccessary to <distance> to correct for this, so you don't have to do the math
  yourself.  Put in the maximum fov you expect a user to be using with this map.
  If a user uses a higher FOV, then HOM effects may start appearing around the
  corners and edges of the screen.

  Standard Quake 2 does not support fog, it is only possible through mods that
  support it.

Configuration Files

  I have added support for configuration files.  When qvis3 loads up, it will look
  for a file called qvis3.cfg.  It looks in the directory you launched the program
  from so if you did:

     d:\games\quake2\utils\maps> f:\quake2\utils\qvis3 mymap.bsp

  it would look for qvis3.cfg in d:\games\quake2\utils\maps, not f:\quake2\utils.

-

  In the configuration file itself, you can add additional command line parameters,
  each line being a seperate parameter.  Lines beginning with a semi-colon (';')
  and blank lines are ignored.  qvis3.cfg command line parameters are processed
  before any actual command line parameters. If you had a qvis3.cfg with the
  following contents:
    
    -level 2

  then ran:

    qvis3 mymap.bsp

  It would be exactly the same as if you ran (with no qvis3.cfg present):

    qvis3 -level 2 mymap.bsp

-

  Additionally, you can call other configuration files from the command line by
  prefixing its name with a '+'.  The contents are processed at that point.  If
  your qvis3.cfg has the following contents (first line is an ignored comment,
  second line is an ignored blank line in this particular example):

      ; Give verbose output
    
      -v

  and a file called final.cfg with the following contents:

      -level
      4
      -threads
      5

  then ran:

    qvis3 -nosort +final mymap.bsp

  It would be exactly the same as if you ran (with no configuration files at all):

    qvis3 -v -nosort -level 4 -threads 5 mymap.bsp

-

  Path information is allowed but no file extensions, examples:

    NOT ALLOWED:  +foobar.cfg
    NOT ALLOWED:  qvis3 +f:\games\quake2\maps\foobar.cfg
    Allowed:      +foobar
    Allowed:      qvis3 +f:\games\quake2\maps\foobar

-

  parameters beginning with a '+' only load configuration files when qvis3 is expecting
  an actual parameter and not a value for a parameter.  The following would not trigger
  loading a configuration file:

    qvis3 -level +2 mymap.bsp

  as the +2 would get used by the -level parameter as a number.

====

Additional Notes

  You may use full path information for file names such as:

    qvis3 c:\games\quake2\maps\mymap.bsp

  If you do not give full path information, it will look for the map in your current
  working directory  Thus:

    c:\quake2\utils> qvis3 maps\mymap.bsp

  will try to find c:\quake2\utils\maps\mymap.bsp

-

  I have removed all DLL linkages,  they were not being used.

-

  The requirement for the file to be in a directory with 'quake2' in the path has
  ben completely removed, even with partial path file names.

-

  One source of hall of mirror effects has been removed.

This archive contains the source to my version of the quake2 compile
tools.  I am pretty much releasing the source under the same terms
as the id released the original source.  I have included the text
files that originally came with with the original id release of the
compile tools, which resides in the id_docs/ directory.  gdd_files/
contains the documentation and executables I released with each of
the last releases of qbsp3, rvis3, and qrad3.  utils3/ contains the
source itself.  While it can be copied over the original source, it
is self-contained.  The last versions of these utilies were compiled
with either Microsoft Visual C versions 5 and 6.

It is not my intention for providing support on how to this this
working, but I may help if I have the time.
